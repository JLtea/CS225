Elon: WHAT ARE YOU DOI-
You: See ya later boomers!

You eject yourself and abandon ship. You have no food or water and limited oxygen. Oopsie!
"At least I have the Office...WHATTT?!" The files are missing.
You start to breath heavily, your heart starts beating. You look around and all you see is endless void.
No stars, no planets, and the ship is long gone.

# waf-space-accept
Realizing that you are stranded, you accept reality, and stare into the darkness.

# waf-space-call
Desperately you make an attempt to call your crew.
